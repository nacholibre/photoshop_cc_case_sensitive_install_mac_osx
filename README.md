# Installing Adobe Photoshop CC on case-sensitive drives (Mac OS X)

Well, everybody knows that Adobe are a **[censored]** company.
Their products are the defacto standard for image/video editing and designing, but their codebase really suck. No excuses.

The problem addressed here is that Creative Studioâ„¢ refuses to install on a case-sensitive drive on Mac OS X.
And it doesn't just refuse to install on a case-sensitive drive, but it also requires to install on your *boot* drive as well! Srsly?

Well, there's a solution. I've just stumbled upon [this](https://bitbucket.org/lokkju/adobe_case_sensitive_volumes), and I'm really anxious to share it.
I've forked the code to update it for Photoshop CC.

## Prerequisites

1.  `Xcode`

    You can install it from [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835).
2.  Command Line Tools for Xcode.

    You can install it from Xcode's `Preferences` -> `Downloads`.

## A step-by-step installation instructions

1.  Create a `.sparsebundle` pseudo-image to install CS6:

    ``` bash
    mkdir -p ~/Stuff/Adobe
    cd ~/Stuff/Adobe
    hdiutil create -size 15g -type SPARSEBUNDLE -nospotlight -volname 'Adobe Photoshop SparseBundle' -fs 'Journaled HFS+' ~/Stuff/Adobe/Adobe_Photoshop_SparseBundle.sparsebundle
    ```

2.  Mount the newly created image and create a `/Adobe` directory inside

    ``` bash
    open ~/Stuff/Adobe/Adobe_Photoshop_SparseBundle.sparsebundle
    mkdir -p /Volumes/Adobe\ Photoshop\ SparseBundle/Adobe
    ```
    
3. Symlink the install directory to the pseudo-image

    `ln -s /Volumes/Adobe\ Photoshop\ SparseBundle/Adobe /Applications/Adobe`
    
4. Run the `Photoshop_Installer.dmg` and don't do anything. This step is needed to mount the installer in the system.

5.  Get the hack, compile it, and run it
    ``` bash
    cd ~/Stuff/Adobe
    git clone git://github.com/nacholibre/photoshop_cc_case_sensitive_install_mac_osx.git
    cd photoshop_cc_case_sensitive_install_mac_osx
    make
    sudo make run
    ```

6. Open the installer that we opened in step 4. It should be running, just click the icon in the dock.

7. Follow the installation procedure.

7. That's it, you are done!
